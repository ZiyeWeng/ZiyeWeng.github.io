Finding My Way to Scholarship

If you had asked me in my first year of university what I wanted to become, I would not have had a clear answer.

What I did have was a feeling of restlessness.

During my first summer social practice, I visited rural communities at a time when national poverty alleviation efforts were being widely celebrated. I met elderly villagers living in fragile houses, holding onto hopes that someone might listen. I remember standing there, wanting to help, yet not knowing what I was capable of doing. It was not anger I felt - it was a quiet sense of helplessness and confusion. I realized how small I was in front of structural problems.

Back on campus, I began searching.

I tried almost everything I could. I joined Student Organizations. Throughout such four years of undergraduate studies, I evolved from a beginner to an organizer. I organized cultural festivals and sports events. I hosted activities, edited videos, participated in writing competitions, stepped onto performance stages, and signed up for nearly every competition I was eligible for. Some of these attempts were clumsy. Some ended in failure. Many required rewriting plans late into the night. But I was not chasing trophies - I was trying to understand where I belonged.

Looking back, what I truly enjoyed was not the activities themselves, but the process of leading - coordinating people, resolving misunderstandings, motivating a team when enthusiasm was fading. Leadership became a mirror. It forced me to confront my impatience, my insecurity, and my fear of failure. Each responsibility reshaped me. I learned to listen more carefully, to speak more clearly, and to think beyond myself.

Through extended social practice projects and internships in local government offices, I gradually encountered a field that was not originally my major: public administration. I observed how policies were implemented at the grassroots level, how bureaucratic routines structured daily life, and how institutional incentives influenced human behavior. The more I observed, the more I realized that many of the questions that once left me confused were not accidental - they were embedded in governance systems.

That realization changed my trajectory.

I decided to pursue a master's degree in public policy and management, leaving my original disciplinary path behind. It was not an impulsive decision, but the result of years of experimentation. What began as scattered attempts to try everything gradually converged into a clearer intellectual curiosity: how institutions shape people, and how people navigate institutions.

Graduate school was not a dramatic transformation, but a process of narrowing and deepening. I became more comfortable with uncertainty, more patient with complexity, and more honest about what I did not know. I stopped asking what role would make me impressive, and started asking what questions genuinely mattered to me.

It has been shaped by confusion, persistence, recalibration, and growth. But through all these stages, one thing has remained constant: a desire to take real-world experiences seriously and to understand them with care.

I am still learning. I am still refining my path.

Scholarship, to me, is not a solitary pursuit, but a shared conversation. Let's continue that conversation together.
